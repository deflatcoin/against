# AGAINST Project

the AGAINST Project aims to develop a fully decentralized ecosystem for crypto assets, including currency, exchange and site.


# NEWDEX Frontend
The frontend is new decentralized Ethereum Token Exchange, with changes that differentiate the need of a central host and / or domain, being able to IPFS or localhost implementation. This does not prevent anyone from making the gateway available in a domain if they wish. The important thing is the freedom to choose the implementation you find most appropriate.

# Dorway Page

It basically consists of a cover, with a friendly name, with access to the system's website that also runs on IPFS.

As for the construction of the site itself there are already dozens of implementations that can be used over IPFS, leaving the project in charge of making just a few tips and recommendations.
