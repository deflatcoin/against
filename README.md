# AGAINST Project

the AGAINST Project aims to develop a fully decentralized ecosystem for crypto assets, including currency, exchange and site.


# DEX Frontend
The frontend is based on Etherdelta/ForkDelta decentralized Ethereum Token Exchange, with changes that differentiate the need of a host and / or domain, being able to IPFS.


# What is ForkDelta/EtherDelta

# #DEX Backend dexDB

The project provides for the development of a decentralized database to accommodate all the needs of a crypto exchange (which we'll call abbreviated dexDB), with a serverless architecture being paramount.

# Dorway Page

It basically consists of a cover, with a friendly name, with access to the system's website that also runs on IPFS.

As for the construction of the site itself there are already dozens of implementations that can be used over IPFS, leaving the project in charge of making just a few tips and recommendations.
